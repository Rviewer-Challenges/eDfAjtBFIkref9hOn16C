## nodejs and npm version

My machine is old has windows 7 the most recent nodejs version that has an installer compatible with windows 7, It is v13.14.0 which become with npm 6.14.2

I would have preferred to choose a most recent version due here is no legacy, compatibility, etc. requirements to justify an old version.
